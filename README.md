# ASL-CNN
A model which can identify the letters of the ASL alphabet.

For now can only consistently identify images taken by a specific person because we didn't have the computational power to train on as wide variety of data as we would have liked. Until we retrain the model with much more data, it is recommended to only try it out on the images provided in the /static/uploads folder.
